# ZitiCore

## Overview
ZitiCore is a Swift-based library for building RealityKit-powered Vision Pro applications. It implements the NOODLES protocol, enabling seamless communication between your app and NOODLES-compatible servers. With this framework, you can import and manage remote content directly in your app's scene.

## Features
- **NOODLES Protocol Support**: Communicate with servers speaking the NOODLES protocol to fetch and display remote content.
- **Fake-Instance Rendering**: Optimize performance using compute shaders to implement a fake-instance rendering approach for efficient scene updates.
- **Gesture Support**: Easily integrate gesture interactions with NOODLES scenes for enhanced user experiences.

## Installation
### Manual Integration
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NOODLESFramework.git
   ```
2. Add the framework project to your Xcode workspace.
3. Link and embed the framework in your app target's **General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

## Usage
### Importing the Framework
Add the following import statement to any Swift file where you want to use the framework:
```swift
import ZitiCore
```

### Connecting to a NOODLES Server
